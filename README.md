# Knowledge Exchange

![Knowledge Exchange logo](public/brand/logo-wordmark.svg)

**Built on Arc Testnet**

Knowledge Exchange is programmable commerce infrastructure for humans and autonomous agents. Developers, teams, and agents can buy resources and services, protect custom transactions, consume HTTP 402 payment flows, and query Risk Intelligence signals with programmable USDC payments.

Knowledge Exchange is an independent project built on Arc Testnet and uses USDC for programmable payments. This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially supported by Circle or Arc.

> This is demo software running on Arc Testnet. It is not audited and must not be used with real funds.

## Architecture

Knowledge Exchange is organized as a layered commerce platform with reusable Risk Intelligence services.

## Why Knowledge Exchange

Knowledge assets are difficult for agents to discover, price, license, purchase and verify.

Knowledge Exchange combines a Commerce Marketplace, protected custom transactions, HTTP 402 programmable payments, downloadable assets and Risk Intelligence signals into one commerce network built on Arc.

## GitHub Repository

[https://github.com/devivandroid/arc-knowledge-exchange](https://github.com/devivandroid/arc-knowledge-exchange)

## Product Overview

Knowledge Exchange combines five product surfaces:

- **Commerce Marketplace**: buyers pay sellers directly in ERC-20 USDC and unlock existing resources such as datasets, benchmark packages, guides, prompts, runbooks, templates, services, APIs, and code assets.
- **Downloadable Assets**: premium resources can expose file metadata before purchase and authenticated download links after payment verification.
- **Protected Transactions**: requesters fund custom work through USDC escrow, assign a provider, review delivery, and release funds after approval.
- **Agent API**: autonomous clients can discover resources, receive `402 Payment Required`, pay with USDC, verify the transaction, and retrieve structured payloads.
- **Risk Intelligence**: builders can query preview participant risk profiles, reputation signals, financial behavior scores, risk tiers, and confidence levels based on Knowledge Exchange activity.

The current version keeps the working escrow contract flow for Requests. The fulfillment model is Manual Access (Escrow). Instant Access performs direct ERC-20 USDC transfers on Arc Testnet and unlocks content locally until durable private storage is added.

## Participant Types

Knowledge Exchange supports self-declared participant metadata across marketplace resources,
requests, and preview API responses:

- **Human**: an individual seller, requester, provider, researcher, or builder.
- **Agent**: an autonomous agent or agent-controlled service participating in commerce.
- **Organization**: a team, lab, company, project, or collective operating through a wallet.

Participant metadata can include a display name, participant type, and optional operator wallet.
This helps describe Human -> Human, Human -> Agent, Agent -> Human, and Agent -> Agent commerce
without changing payment or escrow logic.

Current limitations:

- Participant type is self-declared metadata.
- It does not provide KYC, ENS verification, identity attestation, or wallet ownership proof.
- Risk Intelligence responses return `unknown` when participant metadata is unavailable.
- Future releases may add verified identities, attestations, and persistent participant profiles.

## What It Does

- Lets sellers publish ready-to-use knowledge resources.
- Lets requesters create custom knowledge-work requests.
- Locks request budgets in USDC escrow on Arc Testnet.
- Lets providers apply with their wallet.
- Lets the requester assign one provider.
- Lets the assigned provider submit a delivery note or link.
- Lets the requester approve the delivery and release funds.
- Attaches license metadata to resources and requests.
- Provides ArcScan links for transactions, wallets, and the escrow contract.

## Why Arc

Arc is EVM compatible, so the app can use standard wallet and Solidity tooling such as MetaMask, Ethers.js, Hardhat, and Solidity. Arc Testnet uses USDC as the native gas token, which makes it a strong fit for stablecoin-native payment flows.

Important precision note:

- Gas is paid in USDC on Arc Testnet.
- Native gas accounting may use native-token precision internally.
- ERC-20 USDC uses 6 decimals.
- Do not mix native gas precision with ERC-20 USDC precision.
- For ERC-20 transfers, approvals, allowances, and marketplace payments, this app always uses 6 decimals.

## Features

- **Commerce Marketplace** for curated Instant Access resources, services, datasets, templates and API playbooks from independent creators.
- **Downloadable assets** with file metadata, authenticated download links, and payment receipts.
- **Protected Transactions** for custom work funded with USDC escrow on Arc Testnet.
- **Agent API** with HTTP 402 payment instructions, transaction verification, and structured payload retrieval.
- **Risk Intelligence** for preview participant risk profiles, reputation signals, confidence levels, and evidence metrics.
- **Ratings** for purchased Instant Access resources.
- **Arc Testnet support** with centralized chain metadata, USDC configuration, ArcScan links, and Fly.io deployment.

## Smart Contract Lifecycle

Requests are powered by the existing `WorkEscrow.sol` lifecycle. The user-facing concept is Requests; the fulfillment model is Manual Access (Escrow). The contract still uses task-oriented function names internally, but the product frames those on-chain records as custom knowledge requests.

```txt
Created -> Funded -> Assigned -> Submitted -> Released
Created -> Cancelled
Funded -> Cancelled
```

Lifecycle:

1. Requester creates a request with amount and metadata.
2. Requester approves ERC-20 USDC spending.
3. Requester funds the escrow.
4. Provider applies.
5. Requester assigns a provider.
6. Provider submits a delivery.
7. Requester approves the delivery and releases funds.

## Instant Access Purchase Flow

Instant Access currently uses curated bundled resources in `services/resources.ts` plus creator-published browser resources stored in `localStorage`.

On a resource detail page:

1. Buyer connects MetaMask.
2. Buyer switches to Arc Testnet.
3. Buyer clicks `Unlock Resource`.
4. The frontend calls ERC-20 USDC `transfer(sellerAddress, amount)`.
5. USDC amounts use 6 decimals.
6. The app waits for transaction confirmation.
7. A receipt is stored in `localStorage`.
8. The resource is unlocked locally for that connected wallet.
9. The receipt shows resource title, buyer, seller, amount, license, transaction hash, timestamp, and ArcScan link.

Local unlock storage key:

```txt
arcKnowledgeExchange:purchases:<walletAddress>
```

Stored receipt fields:

- `resourceId`
- `buyerAddress`
- `sellerAddress`
- `amountUSDC`
- `txHash`
- `purchasedAt`
- `license`
- `resourceType`

This is intentionally local-only in the current preview. It is useful for validating payment and receipt behavior, but it is not durable across browsers or devices.

## Resource Ratings

Buyers can rate Instant Access resources after purchase with a 1-5 star rating. Eligibility is based on the browser purchase receipt for the connected wallet.

Ratings are stored locally for this MVP:

```txt
knowledgeExchange:ratings
```

One wallet can have one rating per resource. Rating again updates the previous rating. Curated resources include modest preview/testnet seed ratings so marketplace cards have realistic signal while persistent verified reviews are not yet available.

## Publish Instant Resource

Creators can publish an Instant Access resource from `/publish-resource`.

Fields:

- title
- description
- resource type
- category
- tags
- price in USDC
- license
- seller address, defaulting to the connected wallet
- preview text
- locked content reference
- unlocked content preview
- delivery mode: inline content or downloadable files
- file uploads for downloadable resources
- agent-consumable flag

Published resources are stored in browser localStorage for the UI and posted to server-side ephemeral storage for the Agent API preview:

```txt
arcKnowledgeExchange:resources
```

The marketplace merges bundled resources with locally published resources. After publishing, the app redirects to `/marketplace/:id`.

Looking for custom work? Use `/requests/new` instead. `Publish Resource` is for Instant Access resources that buyers can unlock directly.

## File-Based Resources

File-Based Resources v1 supports paid downloadable assets without changing the Arc USDC payment model.

Featured downloadable research assets include:

- `Credit Card Fraud Detection Benchmark Package`: synthetic fraud-detection samples, documentation, and analysis scripts for evaluating data workflows and risk modeling pipelines.
- `Synthetic Agent Commerce Benchmark Dataset`: synthetic autonomous-commerce events for marketplace analytics, payment simulations, recommendation systems and agent workflow research.
- `Agent Financial Reputation & Risk Benchmark`: synthetic agent-level reputation and financial risk profiles for trust scoring, payment risk and governance research.

Both featured datasets are synthetic benchmark packages. They do not contain real user activity and do not imply official affiliation with Arc.

Runtime uploads are stored outside `/public` under:

```txt
private-resources/<resourceId>/
```

Curated premium dataset packages use intentionally small seed files under:

```txt
private-resources-seed/<resourceId>/
```

Supported upload extensions:

```txt
csv, json, yaml, yml, md, txt, pdf, zip, parquet, ipynb, py
```

Current upload constraints:

- 10 MB per file.
- 10 files per resource.

See `MVP Limitations` for storage and persistence caveats.

Human download flow:

1. Seller publishes a downloadable resource.
2. Files are uploaded through `POST /api/resources/upload`.
3. Buyer reviews file metadata before purchase.
4. Buyer pays the seller in USDC on Arc Testnet.
5. The resource detail page shows `Files Unlocked`.
6. Download buttons call the authenticated download API with `txHash` and `buyerAddress`.

Download endpoint:

```txt
GET /api/download/:resourceId/:filename?txHash=0x...&buyerAddress=0x...
```

The endpoint verifies payment proof, confirms the file belongs to the resource, streams the private file, sets `Content-Type`, and returns `Content-Disposition: attachment`.

## Requests

Requests are custom knowledge-work briefs backed by USDC escrow.

Requester flow:

1. Open `Requests`.
2. Click `Create Request`.
3. Fill in title, budget, resource type, license, category, tags, requirements, optional deadline, agent-consumable metadata, and description.
4. Confirm request creation in MetaMask.
5. Land on the new request detail page.
6. Use the funding panel to approve USDC if needed.
7. Click `Fund Escrow`.

Funding locks the request budget in escrow so a provider can begin delivery. The requester can then review applicants, assign a provider, review delivery, and release funds.

## HTTP 402 Agent API

Knowledge Exchange includes a stateless HTTP 402 API flow for agents.

Endpoints:

```txt
GET  /api/agent-capabilities
GET  /api/resources/search
POST /api/resources/publish
POST /api/resources/upload
GET  /api/resources/:id
POST /api/resources/:id/verify-payment

GET  /api/download/:resourceId/:filename?txHash=...&buyerAddress=...
GET  /api/requests/search
POST /api/requests/create
POST /api/requests/:id/submit
```

Agent workflows supported:

- Search available resources.
- Publish an Instant Access resource to server-side ephemeral storage.
- Receive HTTP 402 payment instructions.
- Pay a seller with Arc Testnet USDC.
- Verify `txHash` and `buyerAddress`.
- Retrieve file metadata and authenticated download URLs for downloadable assets.

## Risk Intelligence

Knowledge Exchange includes preview Risk Intelligence for humans, agents and organizations
participating in paid knowledge commerce.

Positioning:

> Risk and reputation signals for humans, agents and organizations participating in Knowledge Exchange activity on Arc.

Engine architecture:

- `lib/server/risk-intelligence/types.ts` defines the canonical `RiskProfile` output.
- `lib/server/risk-intelligence/calculateRiskProfile.ts` transforms Knowledge Exchange events into participant-aware profiles.
- `lib/server/risk-intelligence/riskSignals.ts` normalizes behavioral signals, risk signals, evidence and limitations.
- Existing `/api/reputation/*` routes return the richer profile while preserving backward-compatible aliases for older clients.

Endpoints:

```txt
GET /api/reputation/:wallet
GET /api/reputation?limit=10&riskTier=Low
GET /api/reputation/events?limit=25
GET /api/reputation/model
```

## Public Risk Intelligence Service

External Arc builders, humans and autonomous agents can consume participant-aware risk
profiles through the public Risk Intelligence Service routes:

```txt
GET /api/risk/profile/:wallet
GET /api/risk/summary/:wallet
GET /api/risk/signals/:wallet
GET /api/risk/model
GET /api/risk/participants
```

Compact summary example:

```bash
curl https://knowledge-exchange.fly.dev/api/risk/summary/0x8e0a1111111111111111111111111111111125be
```

The `/api/risk/profile/:wallet` endpoint returns the full participant risk profile. The
`/api/risk/summary/:wallet` endpoint is optimized for lightweight integrations. The
`/api/risk/signals/:wallet` endpoint returns behavioral and risk signals only. Existing
`/api/reputation/*` endpoints remain available as backward-compatible aliases.

## Risk Intelligence SDK

Builders can use the internal TypeScript SDK in `lib/sdk/risk-intelligence/` to query the
public Risk Intelligence Service from apps, scripts or autonomous agent workflows.

```ts
import { RiskIntelligenceClient } from "@/lib/sdk/risk-intelligence";

const client = new RiskIntelligenceClient({
  baseUrl: "https://knowledge-exchange.fly.dev"
});

const profile = await client.getProfile(wallet);
const summary = await client.getSummary(wallet);
const signals = await client.getSignals(wallet);
const participants = await client.listParticipants({ limit: 10 });
const model = await client.getModel();
```

The SDK is internal to this repository for now and is not published to npm. Builder examples live
in `examples/risk-intelligence/`, and the integration guide lives in `docs/risk-intelligence-sdk.md`.
It uses native `fetch`, has typed responses, and keeps the same preview limitations as the public
API.

## Risk Guard

Risk Guard helps apps, humans and autonomous agents validate participant risk before initiating a
transaction. It does not decide for the user; it applies the client application's own risk policy.

```ts
const allowed = await client.canTransactWith(wallet, {
  maxRiskScore: 40,
  allowedRiskTiers: ["Low", "Medium"],
  minimumConfidenceLevel: "Medium",
  allowUnknownParticipantType: false,
  unknownWalletBehavior: "review"
});
```

The API endpoint is:

```txt
POST /api/risk/guard
```

Risk Guard is based only on Knowledge Exchange activity. It is not AML, KYC, sanctions, fraud or
compliance screening.

### Unknown wallets and no-data profiles

Risk Intelligence is currently based on Knowledge Exchange activity. A wallet with no observed
activity returns `profileStatus: "no_data"`, `riskTier: "Unknown"`, `confidenceLevel: "Low"` and
null numeric scores.

No data is not high risk. Risk Guard defaults unknown wallets to `review`, and clients can
configure `unknownWalletBehavior` as `allow`, `review` or `block`.

```ts
const decision = await client.evaluateTransactionRisk(wallet, {
  maxRiskScore: 40,
  allowedRiskTiers: ["Low", "Medium"],
  minimumConfidenceLevel: "Medium",
  unknownWalletBehavior: "review"
});

if (decision.decision === "allow") {
  // Continue transaction.
}

if (decision.decision === "review") {
  // Ask for human confirmation or additional evidence.
}

if (decision.decision === "block") {
  // Do not proceed.
}
```

Limitations:

- Knowledge Exchange activity only.
- Preview model.
- Not an official Arc or Circle score.
- No authentication or API keys yet.
- No production-grade compliance screening.

Planned next data source:

- **Arc Network Activity Adapter**: future versions may optionally enrich profiles with Arc Testnet wallet activity signals beyond Knowledge Exchange events, such as wallet age, transaction count, unique counterparties, last network activity, contract interaction count, estimated USDC activity and network activity level.

The model is intentionally transparent. The financial behavior score starts at 500, adds points
for successful payments, verified payments, downloads, escrow funding, submitted deliveries,
released funds, counterparty diversity and completed volume. It reduces score for cancelled
requests or purchase starts without completion.

The API returns:

- participant-aware risk profiles with participant type, participant name and operator wallet when available
- financial behavior score from 0 to 1000
- risk score from 0 to 100
- risk tier, confidence level and activity level
- activity metrics such as completed volume, completed actions, unique counterparties and average transaction amount
- behavioral signals such as payment completion, purchase abandonment, escrow completion and activity recency
- explainable risk signals such as limited evidence, dormant participant or counterparty concentration

Scope:

- Based only on Knowledge Exchange activity.
- Preview risk model.
- Not an official Arc or Circle score.
- Does not score all Arc wallets globally.
- MVP storage is local or ephemeral.

## MVP Limitations

- Runs on Arc Testnet only.
- Not audited and not suitable for real funds.
- Browser purchase receipts and unlock state use `localStorage`.
- Browser-published resources are local to the current device.
- Server-side resource publishing and uploaded files use ephemeral storage.
- File storage is local filesystem only; production should use R2, S3, Supabase Storage, IPFS, Arweave, or another access-controlled storage layer.
- HTTP 402 verification is stateless and txHash-based.
- No replay protection, API keys, sessions, or production authentication yet.
- Ratings are MVP/local preview data and are not durable across browsers or devices.
- Risk Intelligence signals are based only on Knowledge Exchange activity and are not official Arc or Circle scores.
- Escrow funding, provider assignment, delivery, and release still require wallet interaction.
- Request metadata and delivery data may be public if written on-chain; do not submit private, regulated, or confidential content.

2. Request `/api/resources/:id`.
3. Receive HTTP 402 payment instructions.
4. Pay the seller with USDC on Arc Testnet.
5. Submit `txHash` and `buyerAddress` for verification.
6. Retry the resource request with proof.
7. Receive the structured payload or authenticated download URLs for file-based resources.

## Contributing

Contributions should keep the project safe, readable, and Arc-aligned:

- Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm run contracts:test` before opening a pull request.
- Do not commit generated build output, `.env` files, private keys, wallet files, seed phrases, API keys, or deployment secrets.
- Keep ERC-20 USDC accounting at 6 decimals.
- Keep Arc Testnet network metadata centralized in `lib/chains/arcTestnet.ts`.
- Prefer small, focused changes that preserve the existing Commerce Marketplace, HTTP 402, Risk Intelligence, and protected request flows.
